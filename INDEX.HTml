            <p class="sectionSubTag"> As a beginner programmer, you'll likely experience a mix of emotions.
                Excitement will come from the endless possibilities programming offers, but you'll also face frustration when things don't work as expected and confusion when learning new concepts.
                When I entered this field, some of my friends were experienced developers, and I aspired to reach their level (not up to 10%). But I remember that everyone starts somewhere. Continuous learning is a core part of programming, as technologies evolve. So stay motivated and embark on this new journey.
                You'll find support in the programming community, and creativity will be your ally as you build and innovate. Time management and patience are key skills, and mistakes are part of the learning process. Embrace your curiosity and remember that every programmer began as a beginner, just like you.
